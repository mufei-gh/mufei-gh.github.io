      <RegularText className="testing">
        Before the team finalized the wireframe and design listed above, we recruited five people to{' '}
        <RegTextGreen> test the Lo-Fi prototype and made improvements as follows:</RegTextGreen>
      </RegularText>
      <Title className="media">Overall Effect</Title>
      <RegularText className="mediaContent">
        The initial design has a pop-up shopping cart while clicking the shopping cart icon at the
        top right corner, while two of the users do not like it because it blocks their vision to
        see items on the page. The change is{' '}
        <RegTextGreen>moving the shopping cart to the right side of the page.</RegTextGreen>{' '}
        Moreover, the team agreed that a shopping cart on the right-hand side with the category list
        on the left-hand side gives users a smoother workflow from left to right.
      </RegularText>
      <RegularText className="testingPara">
        Similarly,{' '}
        <RegTextGreen>the search bar is moved from the upper right corner to the center,{' '}
        </RegTextGreen>
        so users can see the search bar when the shopping cart is open and then search items they
        want to add immediately after closing the shopping cart.
      </RegularText>
      <RegularText className="testingPara">
        Furthermore,{' '}
        <RegTextGreen>the layer of the header in green moved to the top layer,{' '}</RegTextGreen>
        so the shopping cart icon still lights up after the cart appears, making the shopping cart
        icon and the content layer as a whole.
      </RegularText>
      <Title className="media">Details</Title>
      <RegularText className="mediaContent">
        The initial version uses triangle buttons adjusting quantities in the shopping cart, which
        are relatively small, so it is not easy for every user to click them. The team decided to{' '}
        <RegTextGreen>change adjust-quantity-triangles to round buttons.</RegTextGreen>
      </RegularText>
      <RegularText className="testingPara">
        In addition, the team{' '}
        <RegTextGreen>uses a remove icon instead of the usual minus button when the quantity number
          of an item is one,{' '}
        </RegTextGreen>so users know that they can delete it directly, rather than taking another
        few seconds to reach the remove button at the bottom.
      </RegularText>
      <RegularText className="testingPara">
        Another change is the closing button which closes the shopping cart window. There was a
        problem faced in the design process of the initial version: The closing button on the left
        side looks very close to the title shopping cart, which creates some noises in vision.
        However, if moved to the upper right corner of the poping window, the design would not be
        consistent with the usual cognitive process since the closing button usually is placed at
        the upper left corner. To solve this problem, the team decided to{' '}
        <RegTextGreen>move the closing icon down to the row of the title Shopping Cart,{' '}
        </RegTextGreen>
        improving the usability further.
